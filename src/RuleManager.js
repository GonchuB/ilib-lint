     * Register a new rule for the rule factory. The rule can be either declarative
     * or programmatic. If the `ruleConfig` parameter is an object, the rule is
     * considered to be declarative. If it is a function, it is considered to be
     * programmatic.
     *
     * A declarative config for a Rule must contain the following properties:
     *
     * - type - the type of the Rule required. This can be one of the declarative
     *   types. The values for declarative types are limited to the following:
     *     - resource-matcher - Checks resources for matches. Any matches for
     *       the given regular expression the source string must also appear
     *       somewhere in the target string.
     *     - resource-source - Check resources for matches of the regular
     *       expression in the source string. Matches in the source string trigger
     *       issues to be generated.
     *     - resource-target - Check resources for matches of the regular
     *       expression in the target string. Matches in the target string trigger
     *       issues to be generated.
     *     - sourcefile - Check source files for matches of the regular
     *       expression. Matches in the source file trigger issues to be generated.
     * - name - the dash-separated unique name of this Rule, such as
     *   "resource-check-plurals"
     * - description - a general description of what this rule is checking for
     * - note - a one-line note that will be printed on screen when the
     *   check fails. Example: "The URL {matchString} did not appear in the
     *   the target." Currently, {matchString} is the only replacement
     *   param that is supported.
     *
     * An attempt to register a declarative rule that does not have all of the above
     * properties will result in an exception being thrown.
     *
     * A programmatic config must be given as a subclass of the Rule class. The
     * class will be queried for its metadata in order to register it properly.
     *
     * Both the declarative and programmatic rules define a unique name, which is
     * what is used to instantiate the rule using the RuleFactory function.
     *
     * @param {Object|Class|Array.<Object|Class>} ruleConfig the configuration for
     * the new rule or rules to register
     * @throws if the required properties are not given in the declarative config
     * or the Class does not inherit from Rule.
