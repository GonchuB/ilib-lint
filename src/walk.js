/**
 * Recursively walk a directory and return a list of files and directories
 * within that directory. The walk is controlled via a list of exclude and
 * include patterns. Each pattern should be a micromatch pattern like this:
 *
 * <code>
 * "*.json"
 * </code>
 *
 * The full path to every file and directory in the top-level directory will
 * be included, unless it matches an exclude pattern, it which case, it will be
 * excluded from the output. However, if the path
 * also matches an include pattern, it will still be included nonetheless. The
 * idea is that you can exclude a whole category of files (like all json files),
 * but include specific ones. For example, you may exclude all json files, but
 * still want to include the "config.json" file.<p>

 * The options parameter may include any of the following optional properties:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>excludes</i> (Array of strings) - A list of micromatch patterns to
 * exclude from the output. If a pattern matches a directory, that directory
 * will not be recursively searched.
 * <li><i>includes</i> (Array of strings) - A list of micromatch patterns to
 * include in the walk. If a pattern matches both an exclude and an include, the
 * include will override the exclude.
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param {String} root Directory to walk
 * @param {Project} project Project
 * @returns {Array.<DirItem>} an array of file names in the directory, filtered
 * by the the excludes and includes list
